Add tests for the idlelib.debugger module to validate the existing behaviors of the debugger window, the stack frame viewer and the namespace viewer.
Fixed an issue where debug sessions could crash where the previous frame was None (ie. the first frame in a callstack).
Fixed an issue where the Idb class would not set the "botframe" attribute, causing the debug session to crash.
